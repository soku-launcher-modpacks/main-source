{"version":"0.0.2","main":"ReplayInputView+.dll","notes":"### Rollback version\n- fix `AdjustmentMethod=1` the default ini issue that cannot use F9/F10 slower/faster function when using giuroll\n- now you can't see the exact FPS right bottom after slower/faster, and you could make game running on faster than 60FPS\n- Do Not press F9 while you are in F11 pause or game will crash\n- btw F6 info function may make your game drop FPS so not recommend.
