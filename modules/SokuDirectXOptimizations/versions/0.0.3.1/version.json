Moreover, it fixes the problem that the game sometimes freezes in slow CPUs, especially those old, single core CPUs. (Thanks to AKI on CN community and Nekopie for their feedback and testing!)\r\n- Separately display the presented FPS on the left of the game (logical) FPS. You can toggle this feature in `show_fps` of the configuration file `modules/SokuDirectXOptimizations/SokuDirectXOptimizations.ini`.\r\n- [Direct3D 9Ex](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3darticles/direct3d-9ex-improvements) is no longer enabled by default, since there have been some reports that it has performance issues on some devices. You can set `use_d3d9ex` to toggle it.
